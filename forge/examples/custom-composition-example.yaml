# Example Custom Composition
# This demonstrates a custom Forge composition created from scratch
# Tested and validated: 2025-11-11 (19/19 tests passing)

composition:
  name: test-composition
  type: preset
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Custom test composition with both principles and file memory

elements:
  # Principles define development philosophy
  principles:
    - ruthless-minimalism  # Ship simplest thing first
    - coevolution          # Specs and code inform each other

  # Other element types (not used in this example)
  constitutions: []  # Governance rules and constraints
  tools: []          # Executable tools and utilities
  agents: []         # AI agents for automation
  templates: []      # Code generation templates
  hooks: {}          # Lifecycle hooks (pre_commit, post_generate, etc)
  queries: []        # Saved memory queries

settings:
  # Memory configuration - file-based storage
  memory:
    provider: file
    config:
      base_path: .forge/memory  # Relative to project root
      compression: false         # No compression for readability

  # Agent orchestration - how multiple agents coordinate
  agent_orchestration:
    mode: sequential    # Run agents one at a time
    max_parallel: 2     # Max concurrent agents (if mode supports it)

  # Tool-specific default settings
