    Fast iteration with emergent design. Perfect for MVPs, prototypes,
    and time-constrained builds. Validated through real-world testing
    (Pomodoro CLI built in 50 minutes).

elements:
  principles:
    - ruthless-minimalism    # Ship simplest thing that works
    - coevolution           # Specs and code inform each other
    - emergent-design       # Let design emerge from implementation

  tools:
    - scaffold              # Quick project setup
    - plan                  # Lightweight planning
    - commit                # Track iterations

settings:
  memory_provider: file
  memory_scopes: [session, project]
  philosophy: >
    Speed and learning over perfection.
    Ship in hours, adapt based on reality.

workflow:
  phases:
    - name: quick_analysis
      duration: "5-15 minutes"
      activities:
        - "Decompose problem into 2-3 options"
        - "Pick simplest option (ruthless-minimalism)"
        - "Write minimal spec with [DISCOVERY] markers"

    - name: rapid_implementation
      duration: "1-4 hours"
      activities:
        - "Build simplest version that could work"
        - "Single file if possible"
        - "Zero dependencies initially"
        - "Note discoveries in spec"

    - name: iteration
      duration: "continuous"
      activities:
        - "Add features only when pain is real"
        - "Refactor when patterns emerge"
        - "Update spec based on learnings"

  completion_criteria:
    - "Core features work (demo-able)"
    - "Explicit trade-offs documented"
    - "Deferred features listed"
