    ## Purpose: For AI/Agent Use

    This is a **tool** element designed for AI/agent invocation during autonomous
    reasoning and execution. It is not intended for direct user invocation.

    **Key distinction:**

    - **Tools** (this element): Invoked by AI agents internally during their reasoning
    process

    - **Commands**: User-facing slash commands or CLI commands for direct invocation

    If you''re a user looking to interact with this functionality, there may be a
    corresponding command element available. Tools are building blocks that agents
    use to accomplish tasks.

    Everything below assumes you are in the repo root directory, change there if needed
    before running.


    RUN:

    make install

    source .venv/bin/activate

    make check

    make test


    If all tests pass, let''s take a look at the implementation philosophy documents
    to ensure we are aligned with the project''s design principles.


    READ:

    @ai_context/IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md

    @ai_context/MODULAR_DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md


    Now go and look at what code is currently changed since the last commit. Ultrathink
    and review each of those files more thoroughly and make sure they are aligned
    with the implementation philosophy documents. Follow the breadcrumbs in the files
    to their dependencies or files they are importing and make sure those are also
    aligned with the implementation philosophy documents.


    Give me a comprehensive report on how well the current code aligns with the implementation
    philosophy documents. If there are any discrepancies or areas for improvement,
    please outline them clearly with suggested changes or refactoring ideas.
