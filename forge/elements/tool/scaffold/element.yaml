    # Scaffold Tool

    ## Purpose: For AI/Agent Use

    This is a **tool** element designed for AI/agent invocation during autonomous reasoning and execution. It is not intended for direct user invocation.

    **Key distinction:**
    - **Tools** (this element): Invoked by AI agents internally during their reasoning process
    - **Commands**: User-facing slash commands or CLI commands for direct invocation

    If you're a user looking to interact with this functionality, there may be a corresponding command element available. Tools are building blocks that agents use to accomplish tasks.
