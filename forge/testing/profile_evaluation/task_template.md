## Task Information

**Task ID**: task_XX_name
**Category**: [Building/Debugging/Research/etc.]
**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Estimated Duration**: [time range]
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Objective

[Clear, concise statement of what needs to be accomplished]

## Context

[Background information, motivation, constraints]

## Requirements

## Success Criteria

Define how to measure success:

1. **Functional Success**: [Does it work?]
2. **Quality Success**: [Is it well-built?]
3. **Process Success**: [Was the approach appropriate?]
4. **Efficiency Success**: [Was time well-spent?]

## Starting Materials

[What's provided to start with]
