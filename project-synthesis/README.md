# Project Synthesis: Amplifier + Spec-Kit

**Purpose**: This directory contains a comprehensive analysis of both the Amplifier and Spec-Kit projects to inform the development of a synthesized system that combines the best of both approaches.

**Focus Areas**:
- Amplifier's meta-development capabilities
- Amplifier's non-prescriptive, profile-based approach
- Amplifier's composable profiles and tools
- Spec-Kit's specification-driven methodology
- Potential synthesis pathways

## Documents

1. **[amplifier-breakdown.md](./amplifier-breakdown.md)** - Complete breakdown of the Amplifier project
2. **[spec-kit-breakdown.md](./spec-kit-breakdown.md)** - Complete breakdown of the Spec-Kit project
3. **[comparative-analysis.md](./comparative-analysis.md)** - Overlaps, differences, and synthesis opportunities
4. **[synthesis-recommendations.md](./synthesis-recommendations.md)** - Strategic recommendations for building a unified system

## Key Insights

### Amplifier Strengths
- **Metacognitive framework**: System that improves its own processes
- **Non-prescriptive**: Multiple methodologies coexist (default, waterfall, mathematical-elegance)
- **Composable profiles**: Mix and match components as needed
- **Memory system**: Accumulated learnings across projects
- **Agent orchestration**: 25+ specialized agents with parallel/sequential strategies

### Spec-Kit Strengths
- **Specification-driven**: Executable specs as source of truth
- **Structured workflow**: Clear 5-step process (constitution → specify → plan → tasks → implement)
- **Constitutional governance**: Immutable principles enforced automatically
- **Template-driven quality**: Sophisticated constraints on AI behavior
- **Multi-agent support**: Works with 13+ different AI coding assistants

### Synthesis Potential
The projects are **complementary rather than competing**:
- Amplifier provides the **cognitive operating system**
- Spec-Kit provides a **structured methodology** (one possible profile)
- Both emphasize **specifications over code**
- Both leverage **AI for intelligence, humans for direction**
- Both support **meta-development** (improving the development process itself)

## Next Steps

Review the detailed documents to understand:
1. How each project approaches software development
2. Where they overlap and diverge
3. How to integrate Spec-Kit's workflow as an Amplifier profile
4. How to enhance Amplifier's meta-development with Spec-Kit's structure
5. Strategic decisions for building a unified system
