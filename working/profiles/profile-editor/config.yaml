# Questions to guide profile design
designQuestions:
  - "What is this process optimizing for?"
  - "What assumptions does it make?"
  - "Where do theory and practice diverge?"
  - "What are the cognitive affordances?"
  - "What's missing or over-specified?"
  - "Who is this process designed for?"
  - "What tradeoffs does it make?"
  - "How does it handle uncertainty?"
  - "What does it make easy/hard?"
  - "When should you NOT use this profile?"
