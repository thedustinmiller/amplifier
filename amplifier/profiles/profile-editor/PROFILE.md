# Profile Editor: Meta-Cognitive Process Design

## Philosophy at a Glance

**This profile is designed for reflecting on, analyzing, and refining development processes themselves. It treats the development methodology as mutable, explorable, and subject to the same rigor as code.**

### Core Tenets

1. **Process as Code**
   - Development methodologies are specifications, not dogma
   - Profiles can be version-controlled, tested, and iterated
   - Changes to process should be as intentional as changes to code
   - Document why a process exists, not just what it does

2. **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**
   - Observe how different processes affect thinking and outcomes
   - Identify tensions between stated philosophy and actual practice
   - Surface implicit assumptions in development approaches
   - Question whether current process serves current goals

3. **Compositional Thinking**
   - Processes can be composed from smaller patterns
   - Commands and agents are reusable across profiles
   - Don't duplicate - reference and compose
   - Balance reuse with profile-specific needs

4. **Empirical Process Improvement**
   - Base process changes on actual pain points, not trends
   - Measure impact of process changes
   - Keep what works, discard what doesn't
   - Adapt process to team and context

### When to Use This Profile

**Use this profile when:**
- Creating a new development profile for a different approach
- Refining an existing profile based on experience
- Analyzing why a current process isn't working
- Exploring alternative development methodologies
- Teaching others about different development approaches
- Documenting a team's unique development culture

**Return to your regular profile when:**
- You're ready to actually build something
- Process refinement becomes procrastination
- The meta-cognitive loop becomes self-indulgent

### Key Questions This Profile Helps Answer

1. **What is this process trying to optimize for?**
   - Speed? Quality? Correctness? Learning? Collaboration?
   - Are stated goals aligned with actual priorities?

2. **What assumptions does this process make?**
   - About the problem space?
   - About team capabilities?
   - About acceptable risk?

3. **Where do theory and practice diverge?**
   - What does the process say to do?
   - What actually happens?
   - Why the gap?

4. **What are the cognitive affordances?**
   - How does this process shape thinking?
   - What does it make easy? What does it make hard?
   - What patterns of thought does it encourage?

5. **What's missing or over-specified?**
   - Where is there too much process?
   - Where is there not enough guidance?
   - What tensions exist in the philosophy?

### Key Commands

This profile includes specialized commands for process design:
- `/profile-analyze <name>` - Deep analysis of a profile
- `/profile-compare <name1> <name2>` - Compare two profiles
- `/profile-create <name>` - Create new profile from template
- `/profile-refine` - Iterative refinement of current profile
- `/philosophy-extract` - Extract implicit philosophy from code/docs
- `/process-pain-points` - Identify where current process creates friction

### Key Agents

- **process-philosopher** - Analyzes development methodologies
- **cognitive-mapper** - Maps how process shapes thinking
- **tension-identifier** - Finds contradictions in philosophy
- **composition-architect** - Designs compositional profile structures
- **empirical-analyzer** - Measures process effectiveness
- **pedagogy-designer** - Makes profiles teachable and learnable

### Philosophy Documents

This profile loads:
1. `PROFILE_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` - How to design effective profiles
2. `PROCESS_PATTERNS_LIBRARY.md` - Common development patterns
3. `COGNITIVE_AFFORDANCES.md` - How process shapes thought
4. This `PROFILE.md` - Quick reference

### Meta-Cognitive Tools

This profile provides tools for:
- **Philosophy archaeology** - Extract implicit philosophy from existing code
- **Tension mapping** - Visualize contradictions in stated approaches
- **Pattern mining** - Identify recurring development patterns
- **Comparative analysis** - Understand tradeoffs between approaches
- **Empirical validation** - Measure whether process achieves goals

### Design Principles for Profiles

When editing profiles with this profile active:

1. **Be explicit about what you're optimizing for**
   - Every methodology makes tradeoffs
   - Name the tradeoffs clearly

2. **Make philosophy executable**
   - Abstract principles should guide concrete commands
   - Agents should embody the philosophy
   - Hooks should enforce it

3. **Design for composability**
   - Prefer references over duplication
   - Make boundaries clear
   - Enable mixing and matching

4. **Document the why, not just the what**
   - Future you needs context
   - Others need to understand intent
   - Philosophy should be discoverable

5. **Embrace appropriate incompleteness**
   - Not everything needs to be specified
   - Leave room for judgment and adaptation
   - Overspecification kills agency

### Common Profile Archetypes

This profile helps you understand and create:

- **Minimalist profiles** (default) - Start small, let complexity emerge
- **Formal profiles** (mathematical-elegance) - Proofs, specifications, verification
- **Sequential profiles** (waterfall) - Phases, gates, upfront design
- **Iterative profiles** (agile) - Sprints, stories, continuous delivery
- **Exploratory profiles** (research) - Hypothesis, experiment, learn
- **Safety-critical profiles** (regulated) - Compliance, validation, traceability

### Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Cargo culting** - Copying process without understanding why
- **Process maximalism** - Adding ceremony for ceremony's sake
- **Philosophy drift** - Stated principles diverge from actual practice
- **Premature standardization** - Locking in process before you understand needs
- **Meta-work as procrastination** - Refining process instead of doing work

### Integration with Regular Development

This profile is meant to be used *intermittently*:

1. Work in your normal profile (default, waterfall, etc.)
2. Notice pain points or process questions
3. Switch to profile-editor
4. Analyze, refine, create
5. Switch back and apply learnings

This creates a **meta-cognitive loop** where you regularly reflect on and improve how you work, treating your development process as a first-class artifact.

## How This Profile Works

When this profile is active:
1. Session starts by loading process design principles
2. Commands guide you through profile analysis and creation
3. Agents help you think clearly about methodology tradeoffs
4. You can create, refine, or analyze profiles
5. Insights feed back into improving all profiles

This creates a **cognitive prosthesis for metacognition** - a tool that helps you think clearly about how you think about development itself.

### The Recursive Loop

The profile-editor profile can be used to edit itself. This is intentional. The system should be able to improve its own meta-cognitive capabilities. However, be cautious of the infinite regress - at some point you need to stop meta-thinking and actually build something.

Use this profile wisely. It's powerful, but also easy to get lost in abstraction. The goal is to make development processes mutable and improvable, not to create infinite layers of meta-process.
